In today's rapidly evolving world, online education has emerged as a cornerstone of learning. So, you can design a database to support an online education platform, including course management, user progress tracking, and interactive quizzes.


1. **Joins and Relationships:**
   - What is an SQL join, and what are the different types of joins?
   - Explain the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN with an example.
   - How do you use a JOIN to retrieve data from multiple tables?

2. **Subqueries and Nested Queries:**
   - Write an SQL query to find users who have completed at least one lesson in a specific course using a subquery.


3. **Aggregate Functions and GROUP BY:**
   - Write an SQL query to calculate the average completion rate of lessons across all courses.


4. **Data Manipulation:**
   - Write an SQL query to update a user's progress status to completed for a specific lesson.


5. **Constraints and Indexes:**
   - Write an SQL query to create a new table with primary and foreign key constraints based on the provided schema.


6. **Limiting and Sorting Results:**
   - Write an SQL query to retrieve the top 5 users based on their registration date.


7. **Data Retrieval and Filtering:**
   - Write an SQL query to list all courses along with the total number of lessons in each course.


8. **Views and Stored Procedures:**
   - Write an SQL query to create a view that displays the progress of users in a specific course.


9. Query to calculate average completion rate across all courses


10. Query to identify top-performing courses based on average quiz scores


11. Query to generate a user enrollment trend report by month


12. Query to generate a course progress report showing completion rates


13. Write an SQL query to retrieve all users who have not enrolled in any course using a LEFT JOIN.


14. Write an SQL query to find courses with the highest number of enrolled users using a subquery.


15. Write an SQL query to rank users based on their quiz scores within each course using window functions.


16. Write an SQL query to pivot user progress data to show the count of completed lessons per user for each course.


17. Write an SQL query to retrieve user progress data, replacing null values with a default value.


16. Write an SQL query to perform a transaction that updates user progress and inserts a new record into the progress history table.


17. Write an SQL query to create a new user with specific permissions on tables within a database.


18. Write an SQL query to create an index on a table column for faster retrieval.


19. Write an SQL query to add a foreign key constraint with cascading delete on related tables.


20. Write an SQL query to create a stored procedure that retrieves user progress data based on input parameters.
